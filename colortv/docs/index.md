If you want to integrate a virtual currency from you can configureÂ it in the next tab. First enter your virtual currency name and value. The value of your virtual currency should be the amount per $1 e.g. 100 gems, 2 spins, etc. Then choose whether you would like to have a Client Side or Server Side callback and configure either appropriately. 

Next you can choose if you would like to join our Open Marketplace. Our Open Marketplace allows you to gain more users and traction to your app by helping promote other apps. The discovery potential of your app is dependant on how well you promote other apps: the more your users download other apps in the marketplace, the more users you will gain!

Lastly you must choose what type of content you want to be shown at specific placements in your application.  
!!! note "Placements"
    A placement is a specific time or location in your application where you might want to display Replay content to your users.
    
    You can find out more specifics about placements and how to incorporate them in your app [here](androidTVSDK.md#showing-ads)
    In order to show an ad, you must declare the placement in the ad request inside of your code.

###Discovery Center
Discovery Center amplifies the finite amount of content in the App Store to provide users with an extended amount of app, video, and brand recommendations. The duel functionality of the Discovery Center helps cater to all types of developers by serving as a free-marketplace to increase your app's reach or a tool for monetization. Our discovery platform uses machine learning to deliver the most relevant suggestions to your users in a non-intrusive manner.

Configure the way you want to utilize the Discovery Center for your apps in the My Applications section of the dashboard by selecting the option to join our open-marketplace or integrate your virtual currency to monetize. If you are using the monetization component, you will be notified by the SDK that the transaction was successful and your users will be credited by either client or server side callbacks.
